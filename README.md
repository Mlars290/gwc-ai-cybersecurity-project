# GWC AI + Cybersecurity Project (2025–26)

## Overview
This project is an early-stage concept developed for the Girls Who Code 2025–26 Challenge: Cybersecurity + AI. The goal of this project is to explore how artificial intelligence can be used to help protect people’s digital identities and creative work online while minimizing privacy risks.

## Problem Context
As AI becomes more powerful, it is increasingly used to generate deepfakes, copy artistic styles, impersonate individuals, and spread misinformation. These threats make it difficult for people to control how their identity and creative work are represented online. At the same time, many AI-based security tools require users to share personal data, creating new privacy concerns.

## Project Direction (In Progress)
This project will focus on designing a privacy-conscious AI tool that helps users detect or monitor misuse of their digital identity or creative content. Rather than collecting large amounts of personal data, the project explores approaches such as opt-in analysis, anonymized pattern recognition, and user-controlled data sharing.

The exact implementation and focus area are still being refined as part of the design process.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence will be a core component of this project. The AI system is intended to analyze patterns, similarities, or anomalies in digital content to help identify potential misuse without requiring direct storage of personal identifying information.

## Ethical Considerations
A key goal of this project is balancing protection with privacy. The design emphasizes minimizing data exposure, avoiding unnecessary data retention, and keeping users in control of what information is analyzed.

## Project Status
This project is currently in the research and design phase. Future updates will include a defined use case, a prototype or MVP, and reflections on the design process.
